# 🎯 **AWS Database Migration Summary**

## **✅ Congratulations!**
I have successfully completed the **database migration** using AWS **Database Migration Service (DMS)**. 

---

## **🔹 What I Have Accomplished**
✔️ **Created a new managed database** using **Amazon RDS**.  
✔️ **Provisioned a DMS Replication Instance** to replicate data between databases.  
✔️ **Configured Source and Target DMS Endpoints** for database communication.  
✔️ **Modified the Source Database Configuration** to enable **continuous replication (binary log)**.  
✔️ **Successfully Replicated Data** from **on-premises MySQL** to **AWS RDS MySQL**.

## **📌 Current Target Environment**
My environment now looks like this:

🔗 **[AWS DMS Architecture Diagram](../assets/dms-architecture-diagram.png)**

📌 The application is still pointing to the **old database**, but **our data is successfully migrated**!

---

## **🚀 Next Steps**
Now that the database is migrated, it's time to:  
➡️ **Migrate and configure the application server!**  
➡️ **Repoint the application to the new AWS RDS database.**

🔜 **[Continue to Application Migration](./application-migration.md)**  

# **🚀 Migration Summary**

## **✅ Migration Process Successfully Completed!**
Congratulations! I have successfully migrated my application and database to AWS using **AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)** and **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)**.

## **📌 Key Achievements**
✔ **Initialized and configured AWS Application Migration Service (MGN).**  
✔ **Deployed MGN Agent** to the source application server for data replication.  
✔ **Customized the EC2 Launch Template** to fine-tune the rehosted instance configuration.  
✔ **(Optional) Configured post-launch actions** for monitoring and automation.  
✔ **Launched a test instance** to validate the rehost process was functional.  
✔ **Performed cutover migration**, configuring the application to use the target database.  
✔ **Finalized the cutover process**, and performed housekeeping in AWS MGN.
