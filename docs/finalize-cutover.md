# **🚀 Finalize Cutover Process**

## **📌 Overview**
I have successfully **rehosted** my source server to AWS using **AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)**.  
After configuring my **application server**, the migrated workload is now **fully functional** in my target AWS environment.  

Now, it's time to **finalize the cutover process**, ensuring that all replication-related resources are properly decommissioned.

---

## **✅ What Happens When I Finalize Cutover?**
When I finalize the cutover, AWS MGN will:
- **Terminate all temporary replication resources** within **90 minutes**.
- **Uninstall the AWS Replication Agent** from the source server within **10 minutes**.
- **Preserve** the launched **Test or Cutover instances**.

---

## **1️⃣ Finalizing the Cutover on AWS MGN**
📌 **To finalize the cutover process:**
1. Navigate to **AWS Console** → **Application Migration Service (MGN)**.
2. On the **Source Servers** page, find my **source server**.
3. The server should be in **Cutover in progress** state.
4. Click on the **hostname** of the source server.
5. Click on **Test and Cutover** → **Finalize Cutover**.
6. Confirm the pop-up prompt.

✅ **My migration is now officially complete!**

---

## **2️⃣ Verify Cutover Completion**
📌 **To confirm the cutover status:**
1. Go back to **AWS MGN** → **Source Servers**.
2. My source server should now have:
   - **State:** `Cutover complete`
   - **Status:** `Disconnected`

✅ **The migration process is fully complete.**

---

## **3️⃣ (Optional) Archive the Source Server Entry**
📌 **If I want to clean up the source server list:**
1. Select the **source server** from the **AWS MGN Source Servers** page.
2. Click on **Actions** → **Mark as archived**.

✅ **The source server will no longer appear in my active migration list.**

---

## **4️⃣ (Optional) Check Post-Launch Metrics in CloudWatch**
📌 **If I configured post-launch actions, I can monitor system metrics in CloudWatch:**
1. Navigate to **AWS Console** → **CloudWatch**.
2. Go to **Metrics** → **All metrics**.
3. Select **CWAgent** (for memory and swap utilization).

✅ **I can now see real-time monitoring of my migrated instance.**

---

## **🎉 Migration Completed!**
I have successfully:
✔ **Migrated my database with AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)**.  
✔ **Rehosted my application server with AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)**.  
✔ **Configured the application to run in AWS**.  
✔ **Finalized the cutover process**.

My application is now running **natively on AWS**, ready for further **optimization and scaling**. 🚀
