✔️ **Provisioned a DMS Replication Instance** to replicate data between databases.  
✔️ **Configured Source and Target DMS Endpoints** for database communication.  
✔️ **Modified the Source Database Configuration** to enable **continuous replication (binary log)**.

## **🚀 Next Steps**
Now that the database is migrated, it's time to:  
➡️ **Migrate and configure the application server!**  
➡️ **Repoint the application to the new AWS RDS database.**
